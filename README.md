## Film Query Project, Week Six, Skill Distillery ##


### Technologies Used ###

* Java object-oriented classes
* Maven project
* Java SQL drivers and database accessor
* Regular expressions
* Eclipse
* The debug perspective and tools in Eclipse
* Terminal
* Git
* GitHub

### Film Query Functions ###

* Enter 1 to search for a film by number. There are one thousand films in the database. The selector prompt you for a film id number. You must enter a number from 1 to 1000.
* Enter 2 to search for a film using a keyword. Input your search. If the database has a film that matches your search, it will display that film. Otherwise it will let you know that it could not find a film with that criteria and ask you if you would like to try again. Type "y" or "n" to try again or not, respectively.
* Enter 3 to quit.


### Notes ###

* I really enjoyed this project.
* It is wonderful to be working with such powerful tools as SQL and Java and to be able to work with them together.
* I ran into a lot of issues with making the output look good. I worked through those with by temporarily using special methods (Java methods) and then removed them and put that functionality into the toString methods at the end.
* I got stuck for a little while when I broke the search functionality. It turned out that I needed a while loop with hasNext() for the result set.
* I added a special filter from another project to reject any out-of-range input for the menu prompt and the lookup by id number.
